Trouvaille
----------

Trouvaille is an individual course project for the course of **ASP.NET MVC** in Telerik Academy. 

There are 3 types of users:
- **admin**: can delete users and articles for now
- **logged user**: can upload  new articles, photos and places *(trouvaille)*
- **not logged user**: can view everything uploaded by logged users

You can also search articles by title, pictures by descriptions and users. Or you can filter the results by continent! How cool is that?

Also there are many unit tests, which will ensure the correctness of the code.

Pull and get lost in the world of travel! :) 

*P.S. don't miss the cute page-not-found page!*
